A person who intermittently fasts only eats during certain hours of the day. Intermittent fasting has been practiced for thousands of years (1, 2). From an evolutionary stand point, intermittent fasting makes sense. Our ancestors did not have fridges full of food or grocery stores on every corner. Food was not a guarantee, and going days without food was not uncommon.
I have been intermittent fasting since 2018 and do not plan on stopping.</description>
