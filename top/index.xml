      <description>My friends and I are constantly trying and sharing new ideas which can help us live happier and healthier lives. We have been doing this for years and have found and tried quite a few different health practices. Because we have done tons of research and experimentation, we thought we would share what we have learned from our own personal experiences!
This blog is a culmination of everything we have learned and shared with each other.</description>
