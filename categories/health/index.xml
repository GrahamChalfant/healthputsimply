      <description>Intermittent fasting is the absence of food for prolonged periods. It is not a new concept; early human evolution studies suggest humans evolved in fasted environments. This makes sense, as our ancestors did not have fridges full of food or grocery stores on every corner. Food was not a guarantee, and going days without food was not uncommon.
I have been intermittent fasting since 2018 and do not plan on stopping.</description>
