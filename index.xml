Have you ever taken a moment to consider that there are 7.6 billion people on our planet, and each of them uniquely experiences life? Why are some people extremely anxious and others are not? Why can some people give amazing public speeches and others cannot? Why can some people make tons of friends and others cannot? Why do some people seem to fail at everything and others do not?</description>

The story of the Chinese farmer has had a significant impact on my life and well-being.
&amp;quot; A farmer and his son had a beloved horse who helped the family earn a living. One day, the horse ran away and their neighbours exclaimed, “Your horse ran away, what terrible luck!” The farmer replied, “Maybe so, maybe not.”
A few days later, the horse returned home, leading a few wild horses back to the farm as well.</description>

A person who intermittently fasts only eats during certain hours of the day. Intermittent fasting has been practiced for thousands of years (1, 2). From an evolutionary stand point, intermittent fasting makes sense. Our ancestors did not have fridges full of food or grocery stores on every corner. Food was not a guarantee, and going days without food was not uncommon.
I have been intermittent fasting since 2018 and do not plan on stopping.</description>
