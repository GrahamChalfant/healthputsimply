      <title>Intermittent Fasting</title>

      <description>A person who intermittently fasts only eats during certain hours of the day. Intermittent fasting has been practiced for thousands of years (1, 2). From an evolutionary stand point, intermittent fasting makes sense. Our ancestors did not have fridges full of food or grocery stores on every corner. Food was not a guarantee, and going days without food was not uncommon.
I have been intermittent fasting since 2018 and do not plan on stopping.</description>

      <description>My friends and I are constantly trying and sharing new ideas which can help us live happier and healthier lives. We have been doing this for years and have found and tried quite a few different health practices. Because we have done tons of research and experimentation, we thought we would share what we have learned from our own personal experiences!
This blog is a culmination of everything we have learned and shared with each other.</description>
