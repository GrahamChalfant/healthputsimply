      <title>Intermittent Fasting</title>

      <description>Intermittent fasting is the absence of food for prolonged periods. It is not a new concept; early human evolution studies suggest humans evolved in fasted environments. This makes sense, as our ancestors did not have fridges full of food or grocery stores on every corner. Food was not a guarantee, and going days without food was not uncommon.
I have been intermittent fasting since 2018 and do not plan on stopping.</description>

      <description>Hi, my name is Graham Chalfant, and this site is a way for me to share the things I have learned living with a therapist, nutritionist, doctor, and healthcare professional.
I grew up in Charlotte, NC, with a highly health-conscious family. As a child, I thought my parents were psychotic and despised their health choices. I still have trust issues with my mom after she tried to feed my zucchini brownies&amp;hellip;</description>
